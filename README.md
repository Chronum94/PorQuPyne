# PorQuPyne
A Simple Implementation of Quantum Circuits using Numpy and Scipy.

### Description

A quantum circuit simulator, similar to IBM's quantum experience, but with arbitrary qubits, up to ~20-23. Above 23-24 makes the operator matrices too large. By 2**24, you're approaching matrix sizes of ~2-4 GB.
