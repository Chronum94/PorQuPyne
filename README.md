# PorQuPyne
A Simple Implementation of Quantum Computing using Numpy and Scipy.

### Short description
This is a part of a personal/school project that I'm currently working on, and chances are, it's still in a very primitive state. It will hopefully improve, though.

As of 25 Sept, 2016, can initialize state vectors to basis states, uniformly-random-sampled states, apply Hadamard and Phase gates.
